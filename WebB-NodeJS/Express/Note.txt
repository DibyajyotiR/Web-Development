Express :
Express is a light weight nodejs framework design to make the development of server side applications straight forward by providing inbuilt methods for routing ,handling http request/response and intigrating middle ware easily
--Express is a minimalist web application framework built on nodejs which is primarily use to simplify the process of creating web servers.
--Express is flexible and fast which enables developers to built both small and large applications,
--It is commonly used to create APIs, web application abd handling various http methods.

Use of Express :
--Built Web App and API using routing and middleware
--Reduces boilerplate code and coding time compare to  VANILA nodeJS
--Organises functionality with middleware for tasks like authentication,login,and errorhandling
--It allows rapid development of sckelble and mentainable web application

Differences between Express and nodejs
--Routing :(NodeJS) -> In nodejs manual setup mode code require
           (Express) -> Clean and builtIn routing system

--JSON Parsing :(NodeJS) -> manual or 3rd party
                 (Express) -> simple by using Express.json()

--Middleware :(NodeJS) -> needs 3rd party library
            (Express)-> BuiltIn and systematic  middleware support

HOW to create an Express project ?
--To create an Express project 1stly we need nodejs Installed with npm 
--And then Install the E2edxpress package using npm
--After that we have setup our application step by step                              
                              

Route of create and express project
step 1 -Initialize project 
Open terminal and run the command to initialize npm 
-> npm init -y

step 2 -Install express
Install express via npm
->npm install express

step 3 - Create server files
Create a file named index.js or server.js as mentioned in your package.json file.
The file should be present in root directory of the project.

step-4 -Import express module and initialize the express.
const express=require('express')
const app=express()

step-5 -Define a port and start/listen the server
const PORT=8000
app.listen(PORT,()=>{
     console.log("Server running")
})

Understanding request and response in Express :-
request : It represents the http request and contains data sent by the client including path parameters, query strings body data, headers and more. 
response : It is represents http response that an express app sends back to the client ,it provides methods to send data like 
     res.send(),res.json(),res.status()......etc 


app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("This is an example of response")
    console.log(req.method)
})     

Routes in express:-
--Routing defines how an applications end point respond to client requset 
--Express uses method like get(),post(),put(),delete() etc to define routes according to http methods.
--Routes consist of a path and a callback func with req and res parameters.
--There are 2 types of routes :  normal route and parameterized route 
 for ex:-  
app.get("/books",(req,res)=>{
     res.send("normal route")
}) 
app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("parameterized route")   
})

Route Parameter:
--Route parameters are dynamic segments in the url path defined by using a single column(/books/:id),it allows capturing value directly from the url which are than accecible by using req.params in express
  for Ex:
  app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`parameterized route ${req.params.id}`)   
  }) 

--In express multiple parameters are allowed.
--Route parameters are used to select a specific resource like fetching a specific user by id.


QUERY STRING
--Query strings are key value pairs appended to the end of a url after a queustion mark (?)
  e.g: ?price=10000&color=red
--In express query string are accessed in express via req.query object
  e.g: app.get('/search',(req,res)=>{
     res.send(`Search for: ${req.query.q}`)
})

--Query string are used to filtering data ,searching or providing additional parameters to a request.

Route Chaining: 
--Route Chaining allows defining multiple http methods for a single route using app.rout()
--It keeps route dclarations organised especially when handling different operation on one path. 
e.g app.route('/books')
    .get((req,res)=>{...})
    .post((req,res)=>{...})
    .put((req,res)=>{...})
    .delete((req,res)=>{...})

JSON
--JSON stands for JavaScript object Notation.
--It is a light weight text based data format for representig structured Data.
--It uses key value pairs and it easy for both humans and machines to read or generate. 
--It is used for data exchange between client and server in webapplications.
e.g {
      "name": "manas";
      "age": 25 ;
    }
--In JSON format keys are also written in doublecot("").

Use of JSON Web Development:-
--APIs typically send and recieve data in JSON format beacuse it is a language independent and supported by most programming languages. 
--In express res.json(data) sends a JSON response while middleware like express.json()  and else incoming json request
--Some common use cases are sending user data,configuration or the result of database query to the client.

Q.1 What is the role of a middleware?
 It is handle req and res  between the user and server.

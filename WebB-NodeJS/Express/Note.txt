Express :
Express is a light weight nodejs framework design to make the development of server side applications straight forward by providing inbuilt methods for routing ,handling http request/response and intigrating middle ware easily
--Express is a minimalist web application framework built on nodejs which is primarily use to simplify the process of creating web servers.
--Express is flexible and fast which enables developers to built both small and large applications,
--It is commonly used to create APIs, web application abd handling various http methods.

Use of Express :
--Built Web App and API using routing and middleware
--Reduces boilerplate code and coding time compare to  VANILA nodeJS
--Organises functionality with middleware for tasks like authentication,login,and errorhandling
--It allows rapid development of sckelble and mentainable web application

Differences between Express and nodejs
--Routing :(NodeJS) -> In nodejs manual setup mode code require
           (Express) -> Clean and builtIn routing system

--JSON Parsing :(NodeJS) -> manual or 3rd party
                 (Express) -> simple by using Express.json()

--Middleware :(NodeJS) -> needs 3rd party library
            (Express)-> BuiltIn and systematic  middleware support

HOW to create an Express project ?
--To create an Express project 1stly we need nodejs Installed with npm 
--And then Install the Express package using npm
--After that we have setup our application step by step

Route of create and express project
step 1 -Initialize project 
Open terminal and run the command to initialize npm 
-> npm init -y

step 2 -Install express
Install express via npm
->npm install express

step 3 - Create server files
Create a file named index.js or server.js as mentioned in your package.json file.
The file should be present in root directory of the project.

step-4 -Import express module and initialize the express.
const express=require('express')
const app=express()

step-5 -Define a port and start/listen the server
const PORT=8000
app.listen(PORT,()=>{
     console.log("Server running")
})

Understanding request and response in Express :-
request : It represents the http request and contains data sent by the client including path parameters, query strings body data, headers and more. 
response : It is represents http response that an express app sends back to the client ,it provides methods to send data like 
     res.send(),res.json(),res.status()......etc 


app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("This is an example of response")
    console.log(req.method)
})     

Routes in express:-
--Routing defines how an applications end point respond to client requset 
--Express uses method like get(),post(),put(),delete() etc to define routes according to http methods.
--Routes consist of a path and a callback func with req and res parameters.
--There are 2 types of routes :  normal route and parameterized route 
 for ex:-  
app.get("/books",(req,res)=>{
     res.send("normal route")
}) 
app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("parameterized route")   
})

Route Parameter:
--Route parameters are dynamic segments in the url path defined by using a single column(/books/:id),it allows capturing value directly from the url which are than accecible by using req.params in express
  for Ex:
  app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send(`parameterized route ${req.params.id}`)   
  }) 

--In express multiple parameters are allowed.
--Route parameters are used to select a specific resource like fetching a specific user by id.


QUERY STRING
--Query strings are key value pairs appended to the end of a url after a queustion mark (?)
  e.g: ?price=10000&color=red
--In express query string are accessed in express via req.query object
  e.g: app.get('/search',(req,res)=>{
     res.send(`Search for: ${req.query.q}`)
})

--Query string are used to filtering data ,searching or providing additional parameters to a request.

Route Chaining: 
--Route Chaining allows defining multiple http methods for a single route using app.rout()
--It keeps route dclarations organised especially when handling different operation on one path. 
e.g app.route('/books')
    .get((req,res)=>{...})
    .post((req,res)=>{...})
    .put((req,res)=>{...})

  
    .delete((req,res)=>{...})


--req.params.id
---In Node.js / Express, req.params.id is used to get the value of a route parameter from the URL.
req → Request object
params → Contains route parameters
id → The specific parameter name

---req.params
--Used for:Getting values from URL route parameters
Example:
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.params.id);
});
--> URL:/user/101
--> Output:101
✔ Used when value is part of the URL path
✔ Mostly used for IDs


---req.query
--Used for:Getting values from query string (after ? in URL)
Example:
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.query.name);
});
-->URL:/search?name=Dibyajyoti
-->Output:Dibyajyoti
✔ Used for filtering, searching, sorting
✔ Data is visible in URL
Example:
/products?category=shoes&price=1000


---req.body
--Used for:Getting data sent from form / frontend / POST request
Example:
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
});
--Data sent from frontend:
{
  "email": "test@gmail.com",
  "password": "1234"
}
✔ Used in POST, PUT requests
✔ Data is NOT visible in URL
✔ Need middleware: express.json()

---Quick Difference Table
Feature            	req.params	        req.query	           req.body
Where from?	         URL path	             URL ?	         Request body
Visible in URL?	       Yes	               Yes	                 No
Mostly used for	       ID	             Filter/Search	        Form data

Interview One-Line Answer:
--------------------------------
req.params → Used to get route parameters from URL.
req.query → Used to get query string values.
req.body → Used to get data sent in POST/PUT request body.



JSON
--JSON stands for JavaScript object Notation.
--It is a light weight text based data format for representig structured Data.
--It uses key value pairs and it easy for both humans and machines to read or generate. 
--It is used for data exchange between client and server in webapplications.
e.g {
      "name": "manas";
      "age": 25 ;
    }
--In JSON format keys are also written in doublecot("").

Use of JSON Web Development:-
--APIs typically send and recieve data in JSON format beacuse it is a language independent and supported by most programming languages. 
--In express res.json(data) sends a JSON response while middleware like express.json()  and else incoming json request
--Some common use cases are sending user data,configuration or the result of database query to the client.

Q.1 What is the role of a middleware?
 It is handle req and res  between the user and server.

Middleware:-
--Middleware is a function or software layer that sits between the req and res cycle in webapplications in frameworks like express, which enable developer to add modify and handle functionality for incoming req before they reach the final route handler. 
--It acts as in intermediate between frontend and backend for communication , requesting , handling ,logging , security etc.
--In simple we can say it is a function taht recieves req res and the next callback as an argument which allows executing code and make changes to req res object.

Use of Middleware:-
--Middleware is widely used for task such a authentication login errorhandling passingreq-body and adding custom headers.
--Some common buitlt-in and third-party middleware are express.json() , custom logger function , External.
--Middleware can be apply globaly  by using  app.use() or use specific route by using app.get() / app.post()

What is next():-
--The next function in middleware passes control to the other-middleware function in the stask.
--If a middleware does not end the req res cycle it must call next method other the req will hang and not be processed further.

Types of Middleware?
1.Built-In Middleware
2.Thirt-Party Middleware
3.Custom Middleware
4.Application-Level Middleware
5.Router-Level Middleware

Express Router :-
--Express Router is a feature in expressJS tht allows us to create modular and mountable route handler acting like a many express application for specific part of API.
--It helps us to organise routes into separate file like /users, /products, /login , / categories.  So large apps stay clean reuasable and easy to maintain.
--express.router()  create a separate router object or variable that can have its own routes and middleware similar to the main app.

Static File :-
--Express provide a built in middleware express.static()  to serve static file from a folder such as public or assests.
--Static file in express are files like image, css ,client side JavaScript , pdf etc that are sent tp the browser without any server site processing.
--By using static() any file inside public folder becomes directly accessible from its path.
--We can mount multiple static folder  or add a url prefix like app.use("/assests",express.static("public")) to serve file under a specific route segment.
--use()  by using this method we can use middleware

What is EJS?
--EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript which is a template engine that lets us write html pages with JavaScript to generate dynamic content'
--EJS template uses <%= variable%> to display value into html and <% %> to write JavaScriptlogic  such as loops,condition inside the EJS File.
--To enable EJS we need to install EJS Module and write the below syntax 
     app.set("view engine","ejs")
     app.set("views",path.join(__dirname,"views"))
    Once configure by using the avobe syntax express will automatically look for the template inside the view folder,and ejs will render them when res.render() is called.
Server Site Rendering with EJS :-
--A route handler cause res.render('templateName',{data})  and EJS combines the template with the data to produce complete html page on the server.    
--EJS handles dynamic html views while express.static()  serves supporting assest like css and JavaScript used by the views.
--The common structure is views folder for EJS template and public folder for static file.

.env use to use environmental file.

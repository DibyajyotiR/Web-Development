Express :
Express is a light weight nodejs framework design to make the development of server side applications straight forward by providing inbuilt methods for routing ,handling http request/response and intigrating middle ware easily
--Express is a minimalist web application framework built on nodejs which is primarily use to simplify the process of creating web servers.
--Express is flexible and fast which enables developers to built both small and large applications,
--It is commonly used to create APIs, web application abd handling various http methods.

Use of Express :
--Built Web App and API using routing and middleware
--Reduces boilerplate code and coding time compare to  VANILA nodeJS
--Organises functionality with middleware for tasks like authentication,login,and errorhandling
--It allows rapid development of sckelble and mentainable web application

Differences between Express and nodejs
--Routing :(NodeJS) -> In nodejs manual setup mode code require
           (Express) -> Clean and builtIn routing system

--JSON Parsing :(NodeJS) -> manual or 3rd party
                 (Express) -> simple by using Express.json()

--Middleware :(NodeJS) -> needs 3rd party library
            (Express)-> BuiltIn and systematic  middleware support

HOW to create an Express project ?
--To create an Express project 1stly we need nodejs Installed with npm 
--And then Install the E2edxpress package using npm
--After that we have setup our application step by step                              
                              

Route of create and express project
step 1 -Initialize project 
Open terminal and run the command to initialize npm 
-> npm init

step 2 -Install express
Install express via npm
->npm install express

step 3 - Create server files
Create a file named index.js or server.js as mentioned in your package.json file.
The file should be present in root directory of the project.

step-4 -Import express module and initialize the express.
const express=require('express')
const app=express()

step-5 -Define a port and start/listen the server
const PORT=8000
app.listen()

Understanding request and response in Express
request : It represent the http request and contains data saved by the client including path parameter quesry string body data headers 
response : It is represents hhtp response that an express app sends back to the client ,it provid methods data  
     res.send(),res.json(),res.status()......etc 

app.get("/",(req,res)=>{

})     




routes in express: routing defines how an application   respond to client requset 
--express uses method like get(),post(),put(),delete()   etc to define routes according to http
--routes consist of a path and a call back func with req and res parameter
--there are 2 typeof route :  normal route and parameter route 
     for ex:  
app.get("/books",(req,res)=>{
     res.send("normal")
}) 

--route parameter are dynamic segment inurl path difine by using a single column,it allows capturing value directly from url which are than accecible using req.params in express
      for 

--in express multiple parameter are allow
--route parameter are use


QUERY STRING
-- appended 
e.g: ?price=10000&color=red
in express querry string are  acceced via req.query 
e.g: app.get('/search',(req,res)=>{
     res.send(`Search for: ${req.query.q}`)
})

--query string are used to filtering data ,searching providing parameter

Route Chaining: 
--Route Chaining allows multiple http methods for a single route using
--It keeps route dclaration especally operation on one path 
e.g app.route('/books')
    .get((req,res)=>{...})
    .post((req,res)=>{...})
    .put((req,res)=>{...})
    .delete((req,res)=>{...})

JSON
--JSON stands for JavaScript object Notation.
--It is light weight for representig structured Data
--It uses key value pair and it easy for both humans and machines to read or generate 
-It is used for data exchange between client and server in webapplications.
e.g {
      "name": "manas";
      "age": 25 ;
    }
--In JSON format keys are also written in doublecot("").

Use of JSON Web Development
--APIs typically send a in JSON format beacuse it is a language indipendent and supported by most prohgramming languages 
--In express res.JSON()   sends a JSON response while middleware like express.JSON()  and else incoming  request
--Some common use cases are sending user data,configuration or the result of database query to the client.

INTERVIEW BASED :
-React is a frontend library,which is used in order to build the user interfaces and components.
-Express is a backend web application framework for NodeJS, it simplifies serverside devlopment.
-High scalibility:


stateless nature of http request
It stores user data to avoid repeated input by the user.
chatgpt ans
The stateless nature of an HTTP request means that HTTP does not remember user information between requests.


COMMON HTTP STATUS CODE
200 -> ok -> Request successful
201 -> created -> Data created
400 -> Bad Request -> Invalid Request 
401 -> Unauthorized -> No Authentication
403 -> Forbidden -> Access defined
404 -> Not found -> Page Not found
500 -> Internal server error -> server crashed



---Quick Difference Table
| Feature         | req.params | req.query     | req.body     |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Where from?     | URL path   | URL ?         | Request body |
| Visible in URL? | Yes        | Yes           | No           |
| Mostly used for | ID         | Filter/Search | Form data    |


Interview One-Line Answer:
--------------------------------
req.params → Used to get route parameters from URL.
req.query → Used to get query string values.
req.body → Used to get data sent in POST/PUT request body.



What is REST API?
--REST = Representational State Transfer
--A REST API is an API that follows REST principles and uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations.
--It treats data as resources and uses URLs to access them.

REST Rules:
--Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
--Stateless
--Uses URLs to represent resources
--Usually returns JSON

This structure follows REST standards.
GET    /users        → Get all users
GET    /users/1      → Get single user
POST   /users        → Create user
PUT    /users/1      → Update user
DELETE /users/1      → Delete user

Difference Between API and REST API:
--API is a general concept,REST API is a type of API.
| Feature     | API                     | REST API                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Meaning     | Communication interface | API that follows REST rules |
| Protocol    | Any protocol            | Only HTTP                   |
| Data Format | JSON, XML, etc.         | Mostly JSON                 |
| Structure   | No fixed rules          | Follows REST principles     |

--All REST APIs are APIs,But not all APIs are REST APIs.
Example:    SOAP API → Not REST
            GraphQL API → Not REST
            REST API → Follows REST

How API Works Internally?
--Step 1: Client Sends Request:  
        Frontend sends request         -->GET /api/users/1
--Step 2: Request Reaches Server: 
        Server receives request        -->app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) =>{// logic here})
--Step 3: Business Logic Runs:
        Validates data---Checks authentication---Connects to database---Fetches required data
--Step 4: Database Response:
        Database sends data back to server                 
--Step 5: Server Sends Response:
        Server sends JSON response      -->{"id": 1,"name": "Dibyajyoti"}  
--Step 6: Frontend Uses Data:
        Frontend receives JSON and displays it on UI.



Frontend → API Request → Server → Database → Server → JSON Response → Frontend

What is JSON?
--JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
--JSON is a format used to store and exchange data between systems.
--It is mainly used in APIs to send data between frontend and backend.
--JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data between client and server, especially in REST APIs.

JSON works with:JavaScript,Python,Java,PHP,C#,Node.js

JSON Structure Rules:
--Data is in key-value pairs
--Keys must be in double quotes
--Strings must be in double quotes
--Data is separated by commas

JSON Data Types:    String → "Hello"
                    Number → 25
                    Boolean → true / false
                    Array → []
                    Object → {}
                    Null → null

Why JSON is Used?
--JSON is used because it is the standard format for data exchange between client and server.
--JSON data is small in size compared to XML.
        JSON:   { "name": "Ram" }
        XML:    <name>Ram</name>

Why we use stringify?
--Sending data to server
--Storing data in localStorage
--Converting object into string format

JSON.stringify()  
        Purpose:        --Convert JavaScript Object → JSON String
Example:JS
        const user = {
                         name: "Dibyajyoti",
                         age: 22
                     };

        const jsonData = JSON.stringify(user);
        console.log(jsonData);
Output:JSON
        {"name":"Dibyajyoti","age":22}

JSON.parse()
        Purpose:        --Convert JSON String → JavaScript Object
Example:JS
        const jsonData = '{"name":"Dibyajyoti","age":22}';
        const user = JSON.parse(jsonData);
        console.log(user.name);
Output:web server
        Dibyajyoti


Object → JSON.stringify() → Send to server
Server → Sends JSON
Client → JSON.parse() → Convert to object → Use in UI

| Method           | Converts             | Use Case               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| JSON.stringify() | Object → JSON string | Sending / storing data |
| JSON.parse()     | JSON string → Object | Reading received data  |

Without express.json() → req.body will be undefined
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // undefined
});

app.use(express.json()) is a built-in middleware in Express.
app.use(express.json()) is a middleware in Express that allows the server to read JSON data from the request body.
✔ Parses incoming JSON
✔ Converts JSON → JavaScript object
✔ Stores it inside req.body
req.body contains the data sent by the client in the request body.
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); 
});

When It Is Required?
--POST request
--PUT request
--PATCH request

--res.json() is used to send a JSON response from the server to the client.

res.send("Hello")       // Sends text
res.json({name:"Ram"})  // Sends JSON

--res.status() is used to set the HTTP status code of the response.
--It tells the client whether the request was successful or failed.
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Success" });
});



What is exports in Node.js?
--In Node.js, every file is treated as a module.
--exports is used to send functions or variables from one file to another.
